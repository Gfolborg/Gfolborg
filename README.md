<h1>Hi, I'm Gyasi. AI Automation Specialist in Progress üöÄ</h1>

<p>
I‚Äôve always been fascinated by technology, from taking apart electronics as a teen to building working computers out of spare parts. Today, I‚Äôm channeling that same curiosity into the world of <strong>AI Automation</strong> and <strong>workflow orchestration</strong>.

<p>
Currently, I‚Äôm building hands on experience with <strong>automation platforms</strong> like Zapier, n8n, and Make.com, while also strengthening my foundations in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Java</strong>. Through the <strong>TripleTen AI Automation program</strong>, I‚Äôve gained real world experience in <strong>prompt engineering, chatbot development, API integrations, and workflow automation</strong>.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tools & Tech:</strong> Python, Java (foundations), Zapier, n8n, Make.com, API Integrations, Prompt Engineering, Workflow Design, Automation Pipelines, Git/GitHub, Agile
</p>

<p>
This GitHub is where I showcase <strong>AI automation projects, coding practice, and creative experiments</strong> as I continue sharpening my skills through hands on learning and exploration.
